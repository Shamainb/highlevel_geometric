Calculate Geometric Shape Area (Switch-Case Algorithm)

1. Start the program
2. Display the list of geometric figures: Triangle, Square, Rectangle, Circle.
3. Prompt the user to select a geometric figure (A, B, C, D).
4. Read the user's choice into the variable 'choice'.
5. Use a switch-case structure based on the user's choice:
   Case 'A':
     Prompt the user to enter the base of the triangle.
     Read the base into the variable 'base'.
    Prompt the user to enter the height of the triangle.
    Read the height into the variable 'height'.
    Calculate the area of the triangle using the formula: area = 0.5 * base * height.
    Display the calculated area of the triangle.
   Case 'B':
     Prompt the user to enter the side of the square.
     Read the side into the variable 'side'.
     Calculate the area of the square using the formula: area = side * side.
     Display the calculated area of the square.
   Case 'C':
    Prompt the user to enter the length of the rectangle.
    Read the length into the variable 'length'.
    Prompt the user to enter the width of the rectangle.
    Read the width into the variable 'width'.
    Calculate the area of the rectangle using the formula: area = length * width.
    Display the calculated area of the rectangle.
   Case 'D':
    Prompt the user to enter the radius of the circle.
    Read the radius into the variable 'radius'.
    Calculate the area of the circle using the formula: area = π * radius * radius (π is a constant).
    Display the calculated area of the circle.
   Default case:
   Display an error message for invalid input.
6. End the program.
